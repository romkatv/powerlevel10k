Problems with powerlevel9k come with a lot of possible causes.
The problem you have may arise from the used ZSH version to the
configured font or even depend on the terminal emulator you are
using.

So, please help us a bit and describe your problem as detailed as
possible. Here is a little questionnaire to help us ask the right
questions:
  - What does `zsh --version` give you?
  - Do you use a ZSH framework?
  - Which terminal emulator do you use?
  - Which font do you use (for font related issues)?
  - Which powerlevel9k mode do you use (`echo $POWERLEVEL9K_MODE`)?
  - For font issues: Could you post the output of `debug/font-issues.zsh`?
