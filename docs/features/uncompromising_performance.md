# Uncompromising performance

When you hit *ENTER*, the next prompt appears instantly. With Powerlevel10k there is no prompt lag.
If you install Cygwin on Raspberry Pi, `cd` into a Linux Git repository and activate enough prompt
segments to fill four prompt lines on both sides of the screen... wait, that's just crazy and no
one ever does that. Probably impossible, too. The point is, Powerlevel10k prompt is always fast, no
matter what you do!

Note how the effect of every command is instantly reflected by the very next prompt.

Other Zsh themes capable of displaying the same information either produce prompt lag or print
prompt that doesn't reflect the current state of the system and then refresh it later. With
Powerlevel10k you get fast prompt *and* up-to-date information.
