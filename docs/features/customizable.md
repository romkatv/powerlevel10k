# Extremely customizable

Powerlevel10k can be configured to look like any other Zsh theme out there.

[Pure](pure_compatibility.md), [Powerlevel9k](p9k_compatibility.md) and [robbyrussell](../faq.md#how-to-make-powerlevel10k-look-like-robbyrussell-oh-my-zsh-theme) emulations are built-in.
To emulate the appearance of other themes, you'll need to write a suitable configuration file. The
best way to go about it is to run `p10k configure`, select the style that is the closest to your
goal and then edit `~/.p10k.zsh`.

The full range of Powerlevel10k appearance spans from spartan:
