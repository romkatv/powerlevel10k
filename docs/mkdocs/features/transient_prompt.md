# Transient prompt

When _Transient Prompt_ is enabled through `p10k configure`, Powerlevel10k will trim down every
prompt when accepting a command line.

Transient prompt makes it much easier to copy-paste series of commands from the terminal scrollback.

_Tip_: If you enable transient prompt, take advantage of two-line prompt. You'll get the benefit of
extra space for typing commands without the usual drawback of reduced scrollback density. Sparse
prompt (with an empty line before prompt) also works great in combination with transient prompt.
