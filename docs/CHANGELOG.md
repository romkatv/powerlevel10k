# Changelog

## Version 2.8.0

*October 27, 2020*

* Remove last trailing newline when using the copy code button
* Rework docker image and make available at slatedocs/slate
* Improve Dockerfile layout to improve caching (thanks @micvbang)

## Version 2.7.1

*August 13, 2020*

* __[security]__ Bumped middleman from 4.3.7 to 4.3.8

_Note_: Slate uses redcarpet, not kramdown, for rendering markdown to HTML, and so was unaffected by the security vulnerability in middleman.
If you have changed slate to use kramdown, and with GFM, you may need to install the `kramdown-parser-gfm` gem.

## Version 2.7.0

*June 21, 2020*

* __[security]__ Bumped rack in Gemfile.lock from 2.2.2 to 2.2.3
* Bumped bundled jQuery from 3.2.1 to 3.5.1
* Bumped bundled lunr from 0.5.7 to 2.3.8
* Bumped imagesloaded from 3.1.8 to 4.1.4
* Bumped rouge from 3.17.0 to 3.20.0
* Bumped redcarpet from 3.4.0 to 3.5.0
* Fix color of highlighted code being unreadable when printing page
* Add clipboard icon for "Copy to Clipboard" functionality to code boxes (see note below)
* Fix handling of ToC selectors that contain punctutation (thanks @gruis)
* Fix language bar truncating languages that overflow screen width
* Strip HTML tags from ToC title before displaying it in title bar in JS (backup to stripping done in Ruby code) (thanks @atic)

To enable the new clipboard icon, you need to add `code_clipboard: true` to the frontmatter of source/index.html.md.
See [this line](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate/blame/main/source/index.html.md#L19) for an example of usage.
